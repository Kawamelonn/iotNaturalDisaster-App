Through an MQQT client connected in a drone, for example, the data will be sent through several of these drones, redirecting the signal of each person to the local Crisis Management Center. This data (once processed and aggregated to a database) will be displayed in a dashboard in which the operators of the CMC will be able to see all of the signals and work on rescue operations.
